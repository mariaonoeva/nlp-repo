# nlp-repo
Hi! This is my repo dedicated to NLP explorations. I begin small, and later we will see where it will get me. 

My projects:  

1. [NLTK exercises in nltk-book](nltk-book)
2. (in progress) [BA level NLP project](questions/BA_level_project.ipynb)
   - idea: to annotate questions and then train a model that can distinguish polar questions from wh-questions
   - data: Russian literature texts
   - linguistic task: how to automatically annotate questions with wh-words
   - computational task: text preprocessing and a model training
   - NLP tools: spaCy, nltk, Natasha, regex
